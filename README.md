# Job Sequence Problem

Imagine we have a list of jobs, each represented by a character. Because certain jobs must be
done before others, a job may have a dependency on another job. For example, a may depend
on b, meaning the final sequence of jobs should place b before a. If a has no dependency, the
position of a in the final sequence does not matter.

# Setup

1) Clone the repository
2) run `./job_sequence` (Make sure it has executable permission)
3) To run specs

  `rspec specs/lib/job_sequence_spec.rb`
